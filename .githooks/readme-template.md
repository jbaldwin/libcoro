**libcoro** is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

**libcoro** is meant to provide low level coroutine constructs for building larger applications, the current focus is around high performance networking coroutine support.

## Overview
* C++20 coroutines!
* Modern Safe C++20 API
* Higher level coroutine constructs
    - coro::task<T>
    - coro::generator<T>
    - coro::event
    - coro::latch
    - coro::mutex
    - coro::sync_wait(awaitable)
    - coro::when_all(awaitable...) -> awaitable
* Schedulers
    - coro::thread_pool for coroutine cooperative multitasking
    - coro::io_scheduler for driving i/o events, uses thread_pool for coroutine execution upon triggered events
        - epoll driver
        - io_uring driver (Future, will be required for async file i/o)
* Coroutine Networking
    - coro::net::dns_resolver for async dns
        - Uses libc-ares
    - coro::net::tcp_client
    - coro::net::tcp_server
    - coro::net::udp_peer

## Usage

### A note on co_await
Its important to note with coroutines that depending on the construct used _any_ `co_await` has the potential to switch the thread that is executing the currently running coroutine.  In general this shouldn't affect the way any user of the library would write code except for `thread_local`.  Usage of `thread_local` should be extremely careful and _never_ used across any `co_await` boundary do to thread switching and work stealing on thread pools.

### coro::task<T>
The `coro::task<T>` is the main coroutine building block within `libcoro`.  Use task to create your coroutines and `co_await` or `co_yield` tasks within tasks to perform asynchronous operations, lazily evaluation or even spreading work out across a `coro::thread_pool`.  Tasks are lightweight and only begin execution upon awaiting them.  If their return type is not `void` then the value can be returned by const reference or by moving (r-value reference).


```C++
${EXAMPLE_CORO_TASK_CPP}
```

Expected output:
```bash
$ ./examples/coro_task
Task1 output = 9
expensive_struct() move constructor called
expensive_struct() move assignment called
expensive_struct() move constructor called
12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456781234 has 90000 records.
Answer to everything = 42
```

### coro::generator<T>
The `coro::generator<T>` construct is a coroutine which can generate one or more values.

```C++
${EXAMPLE_CORO_GENERATOR_CPP}
```

Expected output:
```bash
$ ./examples/coro_generator
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100,
```

### coro::event
The `coro::event` is a thread safe async tool to have 1 or more waiters suspend for an event to be set before proceeding.  The implementation of event currently will resume execution of all waiters on the thread that sets the event.  If the event is already set when a waiter goes to wait on the thread they will simply continue executing with no suspend or wait time incurred.

```C++
${EXAMPLE_CORO_EVENT_CPP}
```

Expected output:
```bash
$ ./examples/coro_event
task 1 is waiting on the event...
task 2 is waiting on the event...
task 3 is waiting on the event...
set task is triggering the event
task 3 event triggered, now resuming.
task 2 event triggered, now resuming.
task 1 event triggered, now resuming.
```

### coro::latch
The `coro::latch` is a thread safe async tool to have 1 waiter suspend until all outstanding events have completed before proceeding.

```C++
${EXAMPLE_CORO_LATCH_CPP}
```

Expected output:
```bash
$ ./examples/coro_latch
latch task is now waiting on all children tasks...
worker task 1 is working...
worker task 2 is working...
worker task 3 is working...
worker task 4 is working...
worker task 5 is working...
worker task 1 is done, counting down on the latch
worker task 2 is done, counting down on the latch
worker task 3 is done, counting down on the latch
worker task 4 is done, counting down on the latch
worker task 5 is done, counting down on the latch
latch task dependency tasks completed, resuming.
```

### coro::mutex
The `coro::mutex` is a thread safe async tool to protect critical sections and only allow a single thread to execute the critical section at any given time.  Mutexes that are uncontended are a simple CAS operation with a memory fence 'acquire' to behave similar to `std::mutex`.  If the lock is contended then the thread will add itself to a FIFO queue of waiters and yield excution to allow another coroutine to process on that thread while it waits to acquire the lock.

Its important to note that upon releasing the mutex that thread will immediately start processing the next waiter in line for the `coro::mutex`, the mutex is only unlocked/released once all waiters have been processed.  This guarantees fair execution in a FIFO manner, but it also means all coroutines that stack in the waiter queue will end up shifting to the single thread that is executing all waiting coroutines.  It is possible to reschedule after the critical section onto a thread pool to re-distribute the work.  Perhaps an auto-reschedule on a given thread pool is a good feature to implement in the future to prevent this behavior so the post critical section work in the coroutines is redistributed amongst all available thread pool threads.

```C++
${EXAMPLE_CORO_MUTEX_CPP}
```

Expected output, note that the output will vary from run to run based on how the thread pool workers
are scheduled and in what order they acquire the mutex lock:
```bash
$ ./examples/coro_mutex
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9, 12, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 46, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 56, 60, 62, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100,
```

### coro::thread_pool
`coro::thread_pool` is a staticaly sized pool of worker threads to execute scheduled coroutines from a FIFO queue.  To schedule a coroutine on a thread pool the pool's `schedule()` function should be `co_awaited` to transfer the execution from the current thread to a thread pool worker thread.  Its important to note that scheduling will first place the coroutine into the FIFO queue and will be picked up by the first available thread in the pool, e.g. there could be a delay if there is a lot of work queued up.

```C++
${EXAMPLE_CORO_THREAD_POOL_CPP}
```

Example output (will vary based on threads):
```bash
thread pool worker 0 is starting up.
thread pool worker 2 is starting up.
thread pool worker 3 is starting up.
thread pool worker 1 is starting up.
Task 2 is yielding()
Task 3 is yielding()
Task 0 is yielding()
Task 1 is yielding()
Task 4 is yielding()
Task 5 is yielding()
Task 6 is yielding()
Task 7 is yielding()
Task 8 is yielding()
Task 9 is yielding()
calculated thread pool result = 4999898
thread pool worker 1 is shutting down.
thread pool worker 2 is shutting down.
thread pool worker 3 is shutting down.
thread pool worker 0 is shutting down.
